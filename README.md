# BitPrint: Print your Bitwarden vault

**BitPrint** is a React app which turns an [exported Bitwarden vault](https://help.bitwarden.com/article/export-your-data/) into a tabular layout designed to be printed. Processing is handled within the browser.

This was designed primarily as a proof of concept, and using it with your personal data is **not recommended**. Be cautious when handling your exported vault data, and **do not share it with anyone**.

In short, **absolutely do not** import your personal vault on the demo site. Instead, clone this repository and run the application locally.
